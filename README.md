Provided files in the repository:
  - Neural Network: ready-to-use, needs to be imported in Olympus ScanR Analysis software via AI -> Manage neural networks -> Import
  - Training Data set: This data set was generated by ZÃ¤hringer et al. and contains approximately 2.500 images. It can be imported in Olympus ScanR Analysis software via Scan -> open
  - AIstain sample assay for the usage of the neural network

The provided neural network facilitates the usage of Olympus ScanR systems in live cell imaging.
The neural network will be uploaded soon.
