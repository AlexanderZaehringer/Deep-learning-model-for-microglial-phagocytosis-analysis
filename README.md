(Manuscript under revision)

The neural network repository is provided on Mendely Data:
Zähringer, Alexander (2024), “Enhancing microglial phagocytosis analysis through deep learning: A U-Net based approach”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/czh96my8cf.1

Provided files in the repository:
  - Neural Network: ready-to-use, needs to be imported in Olympus ScanR Analysis software via AI -> Manage neural networks -> Import
  - Training Data set: This data set was generated by Zähringer et al. and contains approximately 2.500 images. It can be imported in Olympus ScanR Analysis software via Scan -> open
  - AIstain sample assay for the usage of the neural network

The provided neural network facilitates the usage of Olympus ScanR systems in live cell imaging.
The neural network will be uploaded soon.
Validation and description of the deep learning model is provided in: Zähringer et al. (submitted)
Instructions/extensive protocol on the usage of the neural network in phagocytosis assays is provided in: Zähringer et al. (submitted)
